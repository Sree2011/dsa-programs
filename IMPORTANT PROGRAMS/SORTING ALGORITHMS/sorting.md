# SORTING ALGORITHMS

**Bubble Sort**: Although not very efficient, it’s a simple algorithm to understand. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Insertion Sort**: Efficient for small data sets. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

**Selection Sort**: Simple but inefficient. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning (or end).

**Quick Sort**: A widely used and efficient algorithm. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach, recursively partitioning the array into smaller subarrays.

**Heap Sort**: Efficient and in-place. It uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.

**Merge Sort**: Another efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
